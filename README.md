# TasksList
test assigment for ProgeForce, console task manager
there are two options how to run this console App:
1. You can run it in your IDE
2. Or in your command promt
  I used Maven so yon will need to text in your cmd:
  mvn clean
  mvn package
  java -cp target/taskslist-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.github.taskslist.App
3. Also change your DataSource Properties: DB_URL, USER, PASS according to your database credentials etc in the main class TasksList\src\main\java\com\github\taskslist\App.java
